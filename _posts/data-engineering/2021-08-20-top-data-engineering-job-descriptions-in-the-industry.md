# Top Data Engineering Job Descriptions In The Industry

The world. today, is the world of data. Data is growing all around us rapidly which concerns the necessity of storing, transforming, transportation of these data.


The demand of data engineers is growing rapidly to make these large amounts of data usable, and store them securely. To make the raw data accessible as well as usable, data engineers create analyze model and present them in a comprehensive format.


This article will introduce you with data engineering and its aspects, demand of data engineers. You will learn about **the data engineering job descriptions** and also how to become a data engineer. 


**What is Data Engineering?**
-----------------------------


**Data engineering** is the process of collecting, managing, converting raw data into a usable format so that business analysts and data scientists can access, process, analyze data easily and optimize organization’s performance. In short, data engineering is the process of creating mechanism and interfaces for the information flow and access.


Data engineering is so broad that it may come with multiple titles data analysis, data mining, data visualization, machine learning, AI data analysis, database administration etc.


Data engineers work to construct, develop, test and maintain architecture of data storage as well as database, manage data alongside data scientists, distribute data, data warehouse, and create and develop database table schemas. Deploying sophisticated program to analyze data, deploying machine learning along with statistical methods are also role of a data engineer.


**Data Engineer vs Data Scientists**
------------------------------------


Data engineer and data scientists both work with data but still they have some difference. Data engineers are the builder of the system where data scientists work. Data engineers build and maintain the system or pipeline which allows the data scientists to access and analyze the data.


Data engineering is the infrastructural engineering of data storage where data science is the statistics and analysis of the stored data.


Data engineers work with big data storage and processing, data pipelines, model ETL where data scientists work based on computer programing, machine learning and algorithms, and statistics and linear algebra.


Now you can imagine a clear concept of responsibilities of data engineering vs data scientists.


**Demand of Data Engineering**
------------------------------


Is data engineering a good job? You will find answer of this question by the end of this section.


[U.S. Chief Data Scientist from White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, DJ Patil says, “Organizations are increasingly realizing that in order to maximize their benefit from data, they require dedicated leadership with the relevant skills.”](https://www.datasciencegraduateprograms.com/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/)


At present, with the digitalization of the world, importance of data engineer is increasing. It has been essential to have a data engineer for business, marketing, education, research, everywhere.


Big companies like, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (known as FAANG) are dealing with huge amount of data every day. So, data engineer has become indispensable for them to access, process analyze and use the big amount of data.


[According to Glassdoor, the average salary of a data engineer in USA is around $111,044.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm)  [In Asia, the average salary of a data engineer is around $36974.](https://www.datacouncil.ai/blog/data-engineer-salaries-around-the-world-2019#:~:text=The%20average%20Data%20Engineer%20salary,%2411%2C562%20and%20%2476%2C373%20per%20year.)
