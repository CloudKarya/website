**Ways to get into Google**
---------------------------


Being a non IITian, there are multiple ways you can get into Google without having to rely on non IIT campus placement. Some of them are:


* **APAC test**: The test is open to any final-year student from any APAC country. Every year, between August and January, 4–5 rounds of examinations are normally conducted. They can be participated in as many times as you want. No one inquires as to which university you attended. You just do well on the tests and are contacted for an interview. This is a highly neutral method of selecting good students.


* **Employee referral:** This approach entails having a Google India employee refer your application. This will make it stand out among the thousands of others that Google receives every day. The best-case scenario is to have a friend who works as a software engineer at Google India do it for you. Also, you do not have to know them beforehand. If you are confident enough, reach out to Google India employees  through Facebook and LinkedIn who will be eager to refer you.


* **Online application:** It’s the simplest way to apply for a SWE position, but given how competitive the industry is, it’s unlikely to get you an interview on its alone. In terms of Google India, this is the most popular manner of application: you go to the Google Jobs portal, fill out the application details, and email it together with your resume.
