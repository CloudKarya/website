Data engineering is a broad field that includes designing, building platforms for collecting, storing, querying, analyzing, and maintaining data at scale. A data engineer is one who works for building and maintaining that platform and does other operations and analysis on data. And, we know that you want to know **how to become a data engineer in India**.


A rapid growth of data engineers is being noticed in recent years as companies require the right person to collect, store and use their massive amount of data for analysis. 


How hard is it to become a data engineer? How can I become a data engineer? You will get these answers by the end of this article.


**What is Data Engineering and Who is a Data Engineer?**
--------------------------------------------------------


A conventional life-cycle of data engineering includes architecting and designing data systems, data gathering, and storing, importing, querying, and analyzing a massive amount of data. Performance monitoring and finetuning to make sure that systems are performing at optimal levels are also an essential part of data engineering.  


Data engineers are the professionals who are responsible for building systems that collect, store, manage, and convert raw data into a usable and easy-interpretable form for data scientists and business analysts to evaluate and optimize performance.


The duty of a data engineer can be demonstrated as to-


* Gather business market aligning datasets
* Develop algorithms to transform raw data into usable data
* Database pipeline architecture building, implementation, and maintenance
* Collaborate with business management to perceive company objectives
* Create new data validation systems and data analysis tools


In short, data engineers are liable for designing, developing, and maintaining the database systems, which incorporate the data infrastructure, applications, warehouse, and pipelines.


**Data Engineering Demand in India**
------------------------------------


You may wonder, is data engineering in demand in India? The demand for data engineers in not only India,  but also around the world has sharply increased in recent years.


According to [thehindu.com](https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/data-engineering-in-focus/article34885337.ece), “The Dice 2020 Tech Job Report described data engineering as the fastest-growing career option in technology in 2019, citing a 50 percent year-on-year growth in the number of open positions.”


Data engineering is growing as one of the most in-demand careers in India as the IT sector has emerged as one of India’s fastest-growing industries. Along with the IT sectors, business firms are also hiring data engineers, offering high salaries, to collect data and analyze the business market for business growth.


**Data Engineering vs Big Data Engineering**
--------------------------------------------


How can I become a big data engineer? Before knowing this answer, you must know the difference between data engineering and big data engineering.


Data engineering and big data engineering are almost identical and interchangeable. A data engineer interacts with a large amount of data in large scale computing systems which is acquainted with big data engineering.


[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/big-data-adds-up.htm) says that big data i.e the collection and analysis of the large volume of information that is being available from the advancement of technologies, is on an unprecedented scale. A large amount of data is generated from smartphones, tablets, IoT home-appliance, social media, e-commerce, etc. which can benefit us in almost every field like business, finance, healthcare, science, etc. if skillfully interpreted. That’s why big data analysts are in great demand.


Data Engineer is especially focused on delivering data pipelines from various source systems and delivering them to a data store suited for further analysis. Almost like a data engineer, but more specialized in distributed and scalable systems. 


**How to Become Data Engineer in India**
----------------------------------------


All our concern is how to become a data engineer in India. 


To become a data engineer in India you must possess at least an undergraduate degree.  It’s good to have an undergraduate in Computer Science but it’s not necessary. A graduate from information technology, applied mathematics, statistics, or applied physics can also become a data engineer.


You must have expertise in data structure, algorithms, computer programing, database architecture, and database management. If you are not a CSE graduate, you can have some courses on them from IT training institutes. You must be an expert on database query languages like SQL.


Earn some professional certifications on data structure, algorithm, database management, and administration.


Get an entry-level job as a data engineer. Once you have some professional degrees related to data engineering, it will help you to get an entry-level job. Gain data engineering skills from your first job.


Get some expertise in data engineering and big data engineering tools like MySQL, Apache Spark, MongoDB, etc. It’s very important to have expertise in python or java for data engineers.


Pursue a higher degree to progress in your career. A master’s degree in computer science is very helpful for career growth in data engineering.


**Pre-requirements to become a Data Engineer**
----------------------------------------------


It’s not that easy to become a data engineer. Not everyone can become a data engineer. You must possess some skills otherwise it’s not wise to choose to be a data engineer.


You must have-


* A bachelor degree
* An excellent possession of programming language especially Python
* Knowledge of SQL, data modeling, and management
* Learn automation and shell scripting
