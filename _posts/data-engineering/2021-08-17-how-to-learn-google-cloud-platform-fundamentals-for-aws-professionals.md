# How To Learn Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals For Aws Professionals

Amazon web service (AWS) is the first and leading cloud and on-demand resource-sharing service provider, serving 100+ services from 2006. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is another competitor in this market and holding the second largest market share. Millions of individuals and companies are using cloud computing and other cloud services from AWS and GCP to minimize costs on resources and infrastructure.


AWS and GCP are creating millions of career opportunities for professionals. IT professionals are now moving towards this cloud computing industry.


Here, you will find a technical comparison between AWS and GCP, as well as the **best way to learn google cloud platform fundamentals for AWS professionals.**


**AWS and Google Cloud Platform**
---------------------------------


AWS and GCP are two major cloud service providers holding a 36% of market share together. AWS and GCP are being popular all over the world because of their reliable, flexible, easy-to-use, cost-effective scalable infrastructure management system.


AWS and GCP both service providers serve their clients as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) while offering app modernization, compute, container, data analytics, database, developer tools, IoT, machine learning and some other cloud services.


As the oldest cloud service provider, AWS has gained a bigger user and community support like Netflix, Uniliver, Airbnb, BMW, MI, Samsung, Zynga, etc. On the other hand, within just 10 years of business, google has got some renowned high-profile clients like YouTube, 20th Century Fox, Bloomberg, PayPal, HSBC, Dominos, and more.


**Comparison of AWS vs Google Cloud Platform**
----------------------------------------------


AWS and GCP both are hosting their service worldwide but there is a large difference between their availability zone, where, AWS is being hosted with 66 availability zone and CGP has divided the service into 20 regions.


Google cloud platform uses a global Software-defined Network (SDN) which offers low latency for micro-services and big data processing.


A small comparison of the service infrastructure between AWS and GCP is presented here to understand the technical difference between them.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Services** | **AWS** | **GCP** |
| IaaS | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud | Google Compute Engine |
| PaaS | AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Google App Engine |
| Containers | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Container Service | Google Kubernetes Engine |
| Serverless Functions | AWS Lambda | Google Cloud Functions |
| RDBMS | Amazon Relational Database Service | Google Cloud SQL |
| NoSQL: Key–Value | Amazon DynamoDB | Google Cloud Datastore |
| NoSQL: Indexed | Amazon SimpleDB | Google Cloud Datastore |
| Object Storage | Amazon Simple Storage Service | Google Cloud Storage |
| Virtual Network | Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) | Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) |
| Virtual Network | Elastic Load Balancer | Google Cloud Load Balancing |


You can see the infrastructure difference between the two cloud service providers. Here a question may come to mind that is it difficult to learn GCP for AWS professionals? To answer this question, you need to get the answer of “is GCP similar to AWS?” first.


**Similarity between GCP and AWS**
----------------------------------


So, is GCP similar to AWS? Let’s see.


It’s not a simple task to say whether AWS and GCP are similar or not. But if you have a certain understanding and knowledge about their service and infrastructure you may get an idea.


GCP and AWS both provide the same cloud services. Both offer the same types of cloud services like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. So, services offered by them can be in different names but they are of similar type.


Like, as an IT professional you may find the similarity between them in containers service as they both use Kubernetes engine.


For compute services google uses Google Compute Engine and AWS uses Amazon EC2, but the approach of both the virtual machines are the same under two different names.


Both AWS and GCP offer networking services with high fault tolerance, countless redundancy scenarios, and low latency capable of high-speed data transfer to virtual machines. Both of them use load balancing services to control data traffic across the instances though they have different configurations.


**Is GCP easier than AWS?**
---------------------------


Is GCP easier than AWS? The answer is, yes.


GCP is easier in security and management than AWS. Deployment in GCP is much easier than AWS.


Multiple app instances launching is much difficult in AWS. GCP has a better user interface (UI) that makes using GCP easier than other cloud service providers.


**Learn Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals for AWS Professionals**
------------------------------------------------------------------


To learn google cloud fundamentals, an AWS professional must see the comparison between AWS vs Google cloud certification. Those certifications will reveal the difference between two infrastructure and working strategies.


Once you know the difference and similarities between these two cloud-service providers it becomes easy to decide where to begin.
