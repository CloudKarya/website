# Machine Learning With Google Cloud Platform Jobs 2020

20th Century Fox, eBay, Bloomberg, Target, Pizza Hut – these are not just the names of some of the top companies. These are some of the top companies that have built their internal Machine Learning (ML) practice on the Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, if you are a practitioner of machine learning with [Google cloud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform) or you are someone looking to break into this field to give your career a new dimension, be rest assured. This discussion on Machine Learning with Google Cloud Platform will directionally calibrate you towards your next steps in this field. Also, if you are looking to start off with Machine Learning with Google Cloud Platform, get started with live classes from the [Machine Learning Academy](https://mlacademy.io////register).


Google Cloud Platform for Machine Learning
------------------------------------------


Do you know that machine learning and data science roles have been one of the most in-demand in 2020 – and have proven to be almost pandemic-proof? While that is a fact, the other one is that Google’s core competency is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Management. Needless to say, that you as a Machine Learning engineer or a Data Scientist need to be proficient in multiple aspects. Data storage, ETL, pipelining from a live database and building online models are some of the most broadly classified activities.


The Google Cloud Platform is a comprehensive solution for developers, data scientists, and data engineers to take their projects from ideation to deployment, quickly and cost-effectively. This coupled with the fact that top companies choose Google Cloud Platform for their internal machine learning activities – you can be sure that skilling yourself in Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform is one of the best investments of time and money that you can make. While Google Cloud Platform gets competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, Google’s dominance and competency in data and AI is what makes it a front runner. Here is a quick comparison of the AL and ML in cloud across the three platforms.

Let me get to discussing with you the opportunities, career paths with regards to the Google cloud platform jobs in 2020.


The Most Lucrative Google Cloud Platform Jobs in 2020
-----------------------------------------------------


It would take you not more than five minutes to get on any job portal and scan through all the Artificial Intelligence jobs profiles involving Google Cloud Platform. You would be swamped when you would see how many of the top companies could you be potentially placed in with proper Google Cloud Platform training. Let’s take a look at what are the top job roles.


### 1.      Cloud Engineer


The role of Cloud Engineer is the most in-demand skill in the US tech ecosystem. This means that if you get a Google cloud platform training in this regard, jobs are waiting for you. Now, sure, you would think a Cloud Engineer is more of generalist role in IT. But you would be surprised to know that these roles are gateways to some of the best ML and tech jobs. In fact, a specialist AI cloud engineer develops and deploys cloud infrastructure for AI and ML specific applications and monitors it. If you have some enticing background or education in Information Technology, you should scale up to be a Cloud Engineer.


### 2.      Data Analyst


Data has been giving a retouch to every career path. If you have a flair for using data to drive change, you should consider being a Data Analyst. And what better way to learn Big Data management and modelling on the Google Cloud Platform. Big Data – the sheer volume and velocity of the data that companies generate – makes this job role a special one in any data science hierarchy.


 So, if you have been looking for a good Google cloud platform jobs, you should get some Google cloud platform tutorial and become a Data Analyst.


### 3.      Application Developer


 In a machine learning practice that is running on the cloud, performance, infrastructure, and integration across multiple systems are very vital. Hence, this makes the usual cloud programming to be pretty different from developing a deploying machine learning models and apps. So, what is the role of an application developer? You will scale database solutions and deploy machine learning models and applications in the Cloud.


 If you have a passion for developing customer-end AI applications then this would be your trajectory.


### 4.      Data Scientist


 Undoubtedly, Data Science is the most lucrative Google cloud platform job in 2020. Don’t confuse data science with data analysis, as discussed earlier. While data analysts do analyze data to uncover insights, a data scientist utilizes a broader set of tools and techniques to draw out more sophisticated insights from data. Data Scientist has been regarded as the ‘Sexiest Job Role of the 20th Century. Need I say more?
