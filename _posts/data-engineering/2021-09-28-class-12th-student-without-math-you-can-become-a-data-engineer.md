Data engineering is becoming a popular and tempting profession among the youngsters in the IT field. Data engineering is becoming essential for business growth considering the changing nature of the businesses. 


Anyone must think that only a science student with expertise in mathematics is eligible to become a data engineer. But it’s a misconception. If you think being a 12th student commerce without math that can I become a data engineer – then you are at right place to get your misconceptions cleared and learn more about it.


Can a commerce student go for data engineering? 


Can a physics, chemistry, or biology student become a data engineer? 


Is data engineering hard to learn? 


You will get all the answers here.


Before going to the direct answer to these questions you must know about data engineering and its demand and requirements to become a data engineer.  


**Data Engineering and its Demand in India**
--------------------------------------------


Data engineering is the process of making raw data ready for storing, querying, managing for business analysis. Data engineers are responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines, data mining, data warehousing for later access, developing, maintaining and testing database and big data system architecture.


Through the advancement of technology, tons of data are being transferred daily across the world which also contains consumers like, dislike, needs. Smartphones, laptops, tablets are storing your choice and interests with is being accessible through Google, Facebook, and other applications.


Business firms and organizations need professional expertise in building and maintaining data pipelines, design databases, collecting, storing, querying, and analyzing these data for their business growth. Data engineer’s demand across the world is growing sharply.


Job search reports say LinkedIn posted [19,000+ data engineering jobs](https://www.dqindia.com/data-engineering-jobs-rise-india-heres/) this year across India. Average salaries for data engineers are around 8 lakhs per year. The data engineering job has become the most in-demand job in India.


**Who Can Become a Data Engineer?**
-----------------------------------


Can a commerce student go for data engineering? Is this opportunity only confined to science students who are good at math?


The answer is also positive for commerce students. 


Besides science and engineering students, Physics, Chemistry, Biology graduates, or even a commerce student without Mathematics can go for data engineering. Though it’s not common to go to an engineering profession from other non-engineering backgrounds, many are doing well in data engineering even from a commerce background.


To move into a data engineering profession, you need to be an expert at this job rather than holding some degrees. All you need to efficiently perform your duties. If you can become a skillful data engineering professional, your non-technical educational background will fade and won’t affect your career.


To find the answers for – ‘Can a commerce student go for data engineering? Can you become a data engineer without math? Can a PCB student become a Data Engineer? Being 12th student commerce without math, can I become a data engineer?’ you must know the requirements to become a data engineer.


**Pre-requisites to Become Data Engineer**
------------------------------------------


An undergraduate degree is a must for being a data engineer. It’s best to have an undergraduate degree from Computer science and Engineering or relative departments but not mandatory. A Physics, Chemistry, Biology (PCB) student having proper skills can go for data engineering professions.


You need some programming languages like Python, Java for data engineering. Query languages like SQL, MongoDB, ETL, and scripting language knowledge are mandatory, even if you need to have excellence in them.


You need a good understanding of data structure and algorithms also.


**Can A Commerce Student Become a Data Engineer?**
--------------------------------------------------


If you are a commerce student, you may think, “being 12th student commerce without math can I become a data engineer?” The answer is “Yes”.


As a commerce student, you will not be familiar with basic computer engineering courses like computer programming, data structure, algorithm, database administration, and querying, etc. You have to learn them yourself and gain some professional certification. 


Do some courses on programming languages like python for data science, java, sclera, etc. Earn a certification that will help you to get a call for an interview. 


Complete professional training on SQL, Apache Spark, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.


Your academic knowledge of economics, business analysis, and management are precious in data engineering. 


Better to add some professional certification of data engineering courses in your resume. You will find numerous courses offered by different IT training centers. Get your training from a renowned institute.


It will be hard to get an entry-level first job in data engineering as a commerce student. But once you get your first job, the path will be easier.


**Is Data Engineering Hard to Learn for a Commerce Student?**
-------------------------------------------------------------


The approach of a commerce student to become a data engineer is different. It cannot be said directly that the path would be easy or difficult, it depends on how capable you are of acquiring the skills.


Since you are not familiar with courses related to computer science, it may seem harder at first. Programming languages and shell scripting, database architecture and management may seem hard. But your business understanding, analytical abilities, economics knowledge will help you a lot to grow as a data engineer for a business organization.


**Is Mathematics Necessary to Become A Data engineer?**
-------------------------------------------------------


Mathematics is necessary for programming or data engineering but it’s not mandatory to have an academic degree or course on mathematics. But you have to be an expert on numerical analysis, statistics, probability and logistic analysis. 


If your academic curriculum does not contain math you need to gain the mathematical knowledge required to become a data engineer by yourself or from a training institute or online organization. Never try Data engineering without mathematical excellence, as it’s not wise for a greater career.
