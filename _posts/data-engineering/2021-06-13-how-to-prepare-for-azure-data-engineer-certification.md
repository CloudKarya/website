How to prepare for Azure Data Engineer certification? Which Azure certification is best for Data Engineers? Keep reading this article, and we will walk you through the entire process.


What’s the first thing that crosses your mind when you come across the word Data Engineering?


An Engineer who plays with data? Or someone who builds an Architecture for data to reside?


Well, if yes, you aren’t totally wrong.


A Data Engineer is someone who makes sure that an organization’s data is clean, well-managed, well-stored, and well-maintained. They are the architects of the Data-Driven world.


In more technical terms, Data Engineers design and build the data storage architecture. They transform the data into a usable format and develop data pipeline systems to ensure an uninterrupted data flow. 


As we have transitioned to a world that is becoming more and more data-centric with each passing day, the demand for Data Engineers has surged.


How To Build A Stellar Profile For Data Engineering Jobs?
---------------------------------------------------------


Data Engineering has become the most sought-after field today.


To secure a Data Engineering job, you need to be good at skills that include programming, SQL Databases, etc.


It a broad sector, and you need to choose the skills you need to develop according to the wide-ranging applications of Data Engineering.


**So, Where Do You Begin?**
---------------------------


We suggest you give a shot at the KCE method we’re about to explain.


It helps you divide your journey of Data Engineering into three simple stages.


![KCE Framework](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20547'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
The acronym KCE stands for Knowledge, Certification, Expertise.


### I. **Knowledge:**


Be curious and explore the domain. Understand the technologies used and skills required to work in Data Engineering. Get comfortable with common terminologies and roles a Data Engineer performs.


Understand the various applications that come under the domain, and identify where your interest lies. Once you are sure where you want to head, move on to the next stage.


### II. **Certification:**


Once you know the skills you need to develop, it’s time to get moving. There are tons of resources both online and offline that can help you build the necessary skills. Engage in certifications. They add credibility to your profile. 


Microsoft has always been the top contender and the global leader in the era of data technology. It is aggressively adapting to the new trends and advancing its cloud services.


Azure Data Engineering is one such field that has now gained immense popularity. Azure Data Engineer is one of the most lucrative job profiles out there.


Azure certified Data Engineers are always in great demand and get hired with ease.


#### ***How do you prepare for Azure Data Engineer certification?***


To pass this certification, you would have to take two prerequisite examinations as follows:


1. DP-200 Exam
2. DP-201 Exam


Let’s dive deeper into the structure of certification:


##### **DP-200:** [**Implementing an Azure Data Solution**](https://intellipaat.com/blog/dp-200-certification-exam-preparation-guide/)


The topics covered under this exam are Implementation of Data Storage, Managing and Developing Data Processing, and Monitoring and optimizing Data Solutions. 


This exam is all about implementing and configuring the given tasks in a Live Lab. You need to be familiar with configuring data services on Azure Portal.


##### **DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution**


You need to prove your competency in design, planning, security, and compliance under DP-201.


This exam tests your capability to come up with a design solution to meet the business needs.


Moreover, you also need to be good at designing security guidelines to match the business standards.


And then comes the final, **DP-203: Azure Data Engineer Associate.**


This examination tests your ability to integrate, transform and consolidate data from various sources into an architecture suitable to build a Data Analytics solution.


#### **The next question you might have is: “How hard is the Azure Data Engineering Certification?”**


We would like to say, it is up to your grasping capacity and interests. Clearing a certification exam is not an easy task.


You need to put in consistent efforts to make it through to become an Azure certified Data Engineer.


Since now you know the examination pattern, let’s talk about how you can prepare for this certification. 


There are various Azure Data Engineering training online along with YouTube tutorials that you can refer to. You may also choose to enroll yourself in self-paced courses to build a strong foundation. 


You can begin your journey by referring to the official Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/23110622/collections/1ngybp2dnk1n8z?WT.mc_id=Azure_BoM-wwl) that provides you with a theory course for the DP 203 exam.


Attempt as many practice exams and get on hands-on experience on as many problems as you can. 


### III. **Expertise:**


The last stage is Expertise.


You need to validate your theoretical understanding through practical exposure and experience.


Work on projects and internships to apply the concepts you have learned in this journey.


We hope that this guide solved all your queries about the question: How to prepare for Azure Data Engineer Certification.


There’s no particular age or professional requirement for this certification. Any Azure enthusiast can appear for it.


The Azure Data Engineer certification gives you hands-on experience to build a robust infrastructure for data storage. The key to passing any certification is practice. The KCE procedure that we have mentioned above will help you stay organized and measure your progress on the journey of Data Engineering. So, get certified and take your Data Engineering career to a new height altogether!
