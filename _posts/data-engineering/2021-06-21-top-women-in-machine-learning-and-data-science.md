Ever wondered how many roles in the computing sector do women hold? What’s the percentage of women in Machine Learning and Data Science?


Unfortunately, not many! According to the IBM tech reports, women make up 20% of the total tech roles across the globe.


The Data Sector has seen an unprecedented boom in the last few years. Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering are amongst the sectors that have disrupted the functioning of enterprises and have taken them to a new level altogether.


Data has become the driving force behind transforming the Tech industries and catalyzing innovations.


Thus, this has resulted in an increased demand for Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, etc.


So, how many women are there in Machine Learning?


Only 12% of the female workforce is working in the Machine Learning sector.


What about Data Science? How many female data scientists are there?


26% of women hold a position as a Data Scientist.


That’s a worrying statistic about women in Machine Learning and Data Science. Surprisingly, women are still underrepresented in the technology sector, and their efforts often go unnoticed.


In this article, we will be sharing the profiles of amazing and inspiring women that work tirelessly to contribute to the Tech sector.

Summing Up – Women in Data Science and Machine Learning
-------------------------------------------------------


There are many other notable women in Data science and female Machine Learning Engineers.


While the technology industry lacks a female workforce, they are making efforts to become more inclusive and present opportunities to women. Data Engineering is another newly emerged field that demands more employees in today’s dynamics.


Women in Data Engineering or in general in any data-related field can be powerful allies in shaping the future.


Although the number of women in Machine Learning and Data Science is minor, they have made notable contributions in the Data field over the years.


Many organizations are now making it their mission to diversify the workforce and hire without any gender disparity.


Many women have also taken the matter into their own hands and are working tirelessly to create opportunities and networks in the Tech field for other females.
