The KCE (Knowledge, Certification, Expertise) process breaks the skill development process into three manageable stages.


The first stage of the learning process is Knowledge. In this stage, understand the skills and their scope. 


The second stage is Certification. Begin developing your skills. Engage in certification programs and build up a credible profile. Make yourself technically sound to tackle any question that might be thrown at you during the interview.
