[We have foreseen the data engineering and big data engineering services market to expand $39.50 billion in 2020 to $87.37 billion by 2025 at a 17.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/big-data-engineering-services-market)


Though data engineering is a high rising career and many people are likely to move on data engineering profession, in the last few years there are consequently chronic shortage of new talents. Data engineers’ demand has outstripped supply due to the lack of skills. People often misunderstand data engineering skills as tough and difficult to learn.


It’s high time you got some data engineering free online courses to upskill you as a potential data engineer.

------------------------------------


What education do you need to be a data engineer? In general, data engineering requires a bachelor’s degree from a relevant department and the skills to work with. But, it’s not necessary to have a bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering or data science. There are lots of people working efficiently as data engineers who are from applied physics, applied mathematics, and some are even from a non-science background.


Having the required skills and efficiency to meet the job description, you can be a data engineer also. We have identified a set of hard and soft skills that employers seek in a data engineer.


If you are planning to be a data engineer, you must have a good command of programming languages, especially Python or Java. [83% of companies ask for Python with a data analysis library like Pandas or NumPy.](https://techvera.com/the-state-of-data-engineering-in-2021/)


Strong knowledge and understanding of relational database management system like SQL, MySQL is essential for data engineering. You must have the skill to write optimal queries to quest data from the database. Data structure and algorithm are indispensable for data engineering.


Sound knowledge of ETL and REST APIs is also preferable in data engineering job.


Some soft skills, for instance, critical thinking, analytical skill, ability to convey correct information, ability to take responsibility, attention to detail, ability to make decisions, and multitasking are very important to be a potential data engineer.
